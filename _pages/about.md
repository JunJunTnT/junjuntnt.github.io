I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, advised by Prof. Xiaoyong Li. My research focuses on trustworthy networking and multi-agent collaborative communications. I am committed to achieving intrinsic network security based on existing network architectures and protocols. My work has been published in leading computer science journals and conferences, including TMC, IoTJ, and AAMAS. I also serve as a reviewer for venues such as IWQoS, SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences, and IFIP NPC.
