title: "NDRA: An Efficient Multi-Objective Optimal Routing Algorithm Using Pareto Domination"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/NDRA
excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose NDRA, a multi-objective routing algorithm applicable to an arbitrary number of optimization objectives. The algorithm guarantees the optimality of the resulting path solutions and can be deployed in SDN to optimize end-to-end transmission performance.'
