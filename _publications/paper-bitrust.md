title: "BiTrust: Hybrid Trust Management for Secure Data Transmission in LEO Satellite Networks"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/BiTrust
excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose BiTrust, a multi-layer trust management architecture for LEO satellite networks. We introduce two trust dimensions—state trust and behavior trust—and design dedicated management and computation mechanisms for each. The proposed framework effectively mitigates a wide range of attacks.'
