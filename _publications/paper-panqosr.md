title: "PanQoSR: Leveraging Path-Aware Network for Fine-Grained QoS Routing"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/panqosr
excerpt: 'This paper presents PanQoSR, the first application of path-aware networking to cross-domain QoS routing optimization. PanQoSR is fully compatible with mainstream protocols, including BGP, APN, and SRv6. We further develop dedicated routing algorithms for intra-domain and inter-domain path computation, significantly enhancing QoS assurance in cross-domain transmission scenarios.'
